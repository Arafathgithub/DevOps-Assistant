## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
*   API keys for the AI services you wish to use.

### Configuration

The application requires API credentials to be set up as environment variables.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  Add the necessary variables to the `.env` file. You can use the example below as a template.

```sh
# For Google Gemini API
API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# For Azure OpenAI Service
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="YOUR_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"
```

**Note**: You only need to provide keys for the service(s) you intend to use. The application will show a warning if you try to use a service without the corresponding keys set.

### Installation & Running the App

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-assistant.git
    cd devops-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running and accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to Use

1.  **Select AI Service**: Use the dropdown menu in the chat panel to choose between `Gemini` and `Azure OpenAI`.
2.  **Select Cloud Provider**: Use the next dropdown to set the target cloud for your Terraform script (`AWS`, `Azure`, or `GCP`).
3.  **Enter a Prompt**: In the chat input, type a description of the infrastructure you want to create. For example:
    *   "Create a Terraform script for an AWS S3 bucket with versioning enabled."
    *   "Generate a script for a basic Azure Virtual Network."
    *   "I need Terraform for a Google Cloud Storage bucket."
4.  **Send and View**: Press Enter or click the send button. The AI will generate an explanation and the corresponding Terraform code, which will appear in the "Terraform Explorer" on the right.
5.  **Explore Other Panels**: Click on the headers for "Infrastructure Health" and "Task Manager" to expand them and interact with the monitoring dashboard and your to-do list.
